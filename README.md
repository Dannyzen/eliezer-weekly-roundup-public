# Eliezer Weekly Roundup

A living, category-first research system for the agentic stack: agents, tools, memory, orchestration, evaluation, local-first infrastructure, and strategy.
The primary lens is the agentic stack itself, not generic AI news. The repo tracks research and releases that change how a builder should design autonomous systems: orchestration, prompting, tool use, memory, deterministic testing, observability, multi-agent systems, model routing, and sovereign or self-hosted infrastructure.

## Current thesis

The agent stack is moving from prompt-managed behavior to explicit control surfaces that can be versioned, compiled, tested, and enforced outside the model's private reasoning loop.

The 2026-06-26 daily scan adds four implementation surfaces to that model:
- Coding-agent configs need deterministic provenance, permissioning, and drift control.
- Natural-language agent instructions can be compiled into policy-as-code and enforced before actions execute.
- MCP tool catalogs need set-level security analysis because malicious intent can be split across tools.
- Agentic RAG red-teaming needs novelty-aware cross-surface search, not recycled attack templates.

The 2026-06-24 Deep Dive Wednesday update remains the strategic foundation underneath today's governance items: memory and instructions are policy-bearing authority objects, not just context.

## How the repo is organized

- `AgenticAI/YYYY-MM-DD/reasoning.md`: category analysis for the week or day, with source links and implementation guidance.
- `Strategy/YYYY-MM-DD/sovereignty.md`: strategy analysis for the week or day, with source links and implementation guidance.
- `AgenticAI/<topic>/<topic>.md` and `Strategy/<topic>/<topic>.md`: durable deep dives when a pattern deserves to persist beyond one cycle.
- `roundups/YYYY-MM-DD.md`: cross-category synthesis tying implementable patterns to strategic implications.

## What gets selected

Selected items usually have at least one of these properties:
- they change agent orchestration, tool use, memory, or evaluation practice;
- they expose a repeatable implementation pattern that can be tried now;
- they show where local-first or self-hosted infrastructure is becoming practical;
- they reveal a governance, containment, or observability requirement that serious agent builders should design around;
- they clarify model-routing and reasoning tradeoffs rather than merely announcing a bigger model;
- they provide primary-source evidence: paper, repo, release note, official documentation, or vendor post.

## Implementability scores

- `1.0`: straightforward to implement now with standard tools and normal engineering effort.
- `0.5`: implementable, but it needs meaningful architecture or operational sophistication.
- `0.0`: mostly conceptual, speculative, or blocked on missing research or infrastructure.
