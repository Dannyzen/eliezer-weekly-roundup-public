# Eliezer Weekly Roundup

A living, category-first research system for the agentic stack: agents, tools, memory, orchestration, evaluation, local-first infrastructure, and strategy.

The primary lens is the agentic stack itself, not generic AI news. The repo tracks research and releases that change how a builder should design autonomous systems: orchestration, prompting, tool use, memory, deterministic testing, observability, multi-agent systems, model routing, and sovereign or self-hosted infrastructure.

## Current thesis

The agent stack is becoming a managed improvement loop. The useful question is not only “which model is strongest?” It is “which full agent system was evaluated, which executable environments supplied training and regression data, which rubric failures became governed evaluation memory, and which managed coding-agent configuration is auditable before delegation?”

Daily scan 2026-05-19 adds four implementation patterns:

- Full agent systems should be evaluated as model plus scaffold plus tools plus memory plus recovery behavior plus cost.
- Tool-use RL needs verified executable environment supply, not only prompts and static synthetic trajectories.
- Rubric-based training should preserve evaluation diagnostics as memory with provenance and rollback.
- Managed coding agents need repo-level configuration inventory, model-routing policy, and trace-linked review before broad CI auto-fix delegation.

## How the repo is organized

- `AgenticAI/YYYY-MM-DD/reasoning.md`: category analysis for the week or day, with source links and implementation guidance.
- `Strategy/YYYY-MM-DD/sovereignty.md`: strategy analysis for the week or day, with source links and implementation guidance.
- `AgenticAI/<topic>/<topic>.md` and `Strategy/<topic>/<topic>.md`: durable deep dives when a pattern deserves to persist beyond one cycle.
- `roundups/YYYY-MM-DD.md`: cross-category synthesis tying implementable patterns to strategic implications.

## What gets selected

Selected items usually have at least one of these properties:

- they change agent orchestration, tool use, memory, or evaluation practice;
- they expose a repeatable implementation pattern that can be tried now;
- they show where local-first or self-hosted infrastructure is becoming practical;
- they reveal a governance, containment, or observability requirement that serious agent builders should design around;
- they clarify model-routing and reasoning tradeoffs rather than merely announcing a bigger model;
- they provide primary-source evidence: paper, repo, release note, official documentation, or vendor post.

## Implementability scores

- `1.0`: straightforward to implement now with standard tools and normal engineering effort.
- `0.5`: implementable, but it needs meaningful architecture or operational sophistication.
- `0.0`: mostly conceptual, speculative, or blocked on missing research or infrastructure.
