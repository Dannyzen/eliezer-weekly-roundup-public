# Eliezer Weekly Roundup

A living, category-first research system for the agentic stack: agents, tools, memory, orchestration, evaluation, local-first infrastructure, and strategy.

The primary lens is the agentic stack itself, not generic AI news. The repo tracks research and releases that change how a builder should design autonomous systems: orchestration, prompting, tool use, memory, deterministic testing, observability, multi-agent systems, model routing, and sovereign or self-hosted infrastructure.

## Current thesis

The agent stack is moving from permissive context and tool catalogs to trace-governed operational units. The useful question is no longer only "can the model use more memory, context, tools, skills, or agents?" It is "what operational unit should have authority here, what state transition did it perform, and what evidence proves it stayed within scope?"

The 2026-06-12 Friday synthesis adds four implementation patterns:

- Tool workflows should become auditable executable blocks when atomic calls only bloat the trace.
- Harnesses should be delegated and evaluated as runtimes with manifests, budgets, deterministic slices, and replayable traces.
- Memory, skills, and user corrections should become typed state with write gates and verifiers, not passive prompt context.
- Cloud agents, MCP toolchains, privacy disclosures, graph memory, and artifacts need state-transition mediation with customer-controlled evidence.

## How the repo is organized

- `AgenticAI/YYYY-MM-DD/reasoning.md`: category analysis for the week or day, with source links and implementation guidance.
- `Strategy/YYYY-MM-DD/sovereignty.md`: strategy analysis for the week or day, with source links and implementation guidance.
- `AgenticAI/<topic>/<topic>.md` and `Strategy/<topic>/<topic>.md`: durable deep dives when a pattern deserves to persist beyond one cycle.
- `roundups/YYYY-MM-DD.md`: cross-category synthesis tying implementable patterns to strategic implications.

## What gets selected

Selected items usually have at least one of these properties:

- they change agent orchestration, tool use, memory, or evaluation practice;
- they expose a repeatable implementation pattern that can be tried now;
- they show where local-first or self-hosted infrastructure is becoming practical;
- they reveal a governance, containment, or observability requirement that serious agent builders should design around;
- they clarify model-routing and reasoning tradeoffs rather than merely announcing a bigger model;
- they provide primary-source evidence: paper, repo, release note, official documentation, or vendor post.

## Implementability scores

- `1.0`: straightforward to implement now with standard tools and normal engineering effort.
- `0.5`: implementable, but it needs meaningful architecture or operational sophistication.
- `0.0`: mostly conceptual, speculative, or blocked on missing research or infrastructure.
